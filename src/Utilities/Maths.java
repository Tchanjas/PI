     * This method calculates squared roots through a series of approximations, starting at any value near the real squared root value.
     * Dividing val by the first approximation gives the second approximation.
     * The average between those two is a value closer to the desired squared root
     * This is repeated until the 3ยบ approx in iteration X = 3ยบ approx in iteration X-1
